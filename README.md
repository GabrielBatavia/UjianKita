# UjianKita

**UjianKita** is a web-first Computer-Based Testing (CBT) platform designed for official school examinations on students' personal Android phones (via **ExamBro**) and iPhones (via **Safe Exam Browser / SEB**), paired with web workspaces for school administrators and teachers.

> **Current Stage — Phase 1 (Foundation):**
> This repository implements the Phase 1 foundation: Next.js App Router architecture, strict TypeScript, Bahasa Indonesia UI/UX design system, Supabase Auth integration, RBAC & RLS database schema, school academic administration, honest Phase 2 placeholders, automated tests, and CI. **Phase 1 must not be represented as ready for official high-stakes examinations until Phases 2–4 (examination engine, device matrix testing, load testing, and backup drills) are completed.**

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (LTS recommended) and `npm`
- Git
- A Supabase project (cloud or local Supabase CLI with Docker)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — e.g. `http://localhost:3000`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase public anon/publishable key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Server-only key used exclusively for administrative user provisioning (`never` prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`)

### 3. Apply Database Migrations

Apply the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in chronological order (`20261112000001_phase1_foundation_schema.sql`, then `20261112000002_phase1_rls_and_functions.sql`). For non-production local testing, you may also run `supabase/seed.sql` and provision initial auth accounts via Supabase Auth.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Health check telemetry is exposed at `GET /api/health`.

### 5. Verification Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```
